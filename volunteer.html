  <p>In my spare time I volunteer as the Vice President of Sport Oakville where I head the Development Grants which are provided in conjunction with the Town of Oakville to non-profit sport organizations in Oakville to support their sport programs in
    the community.</p>

  <p>
    I am currently the Vice President of Sport Oakville and have volunteered my time with the organization since May 2017. Growing up in Oakville, I participated in many sports including Hockey, Oakville Little League Baseball and have a Black
    Belt in Karate. I have also taught tennis, hockey and karate at various camps and organizations in the Oakville and Peel communities and continue to be active in sport.
